how does it work?


your "hash age"

the signed statement from the third party:

take secret/seed S and hash it N times (where N is the number of days since you were born until T, some terminal date)

to assert that you're N days old, you provide your hash age in days N days ago: "assertion"

to verify that you're N years old, you hash from proof N days ago to T


birthday ----> N days ago ----> today ----> terminal date

^-------------- third party statement ------------------^

^----- assertion -------^

                         ^-------- verification --------^
